## Welcome

I am a Senior Research Scientist at Siemens Corporate Technology and a Research Associate at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.
My interests are networked embedded systems, RESTful environments, and building an Internet of Things around them.
I am a contributer to the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/), a member of the [Eclipse IoT Working Group](http://iot.eclipse.org/),
and the creator of the [Californium](https://www.eclipse.org/californium) (Cf), [Erbium](https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki) (Er), and [Copper](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/copper-270430/) (Cu) open-source implementations of the [Constrained Application Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252) (CoAP).
